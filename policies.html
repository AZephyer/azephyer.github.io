        <h2>Client Number</h2>
        <p>This number is for payment methods and record-keeping. Ensure all correspondence has this client number included.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation and Session Rescheduling</h2>
        <p>If you need to cancel or reschedule a session, please do so at least 24 hours in advance. Cancellations or rescheduling requests made less than 24 hours before the session may be subject to a fee.</p>

        <h2>Session Completion</h2>
        <p>Each session is designed to last 1 hour and 15 minutes. This time includes a review of the previous session, core mediation, and planning for the upcoming week.</p>

        <h2>Session Cancellation (Early-End)</h2>
        <p>If either party feels the need to end a session early, this can be done at any point. The remaining time will be credited to the next session or refunded, depending on the circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to me. All sessions are confidential and follow provincial laws regarding confidentiality and privacy.</p>

        <h2>Remote Sessions</h2>
        <p>All sessions are conducted remotely via Zoom. Documents are shared through Google Docs and Google Drive. Email is the primary method of correspondence, though phone can be used if preferred. If you need accommodations, please inform me so I can facilitate this.</p>
